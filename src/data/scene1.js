    "Prologue": "It happened so fast. I remember laughing, gossiping with you about the world, and enjoying the aura of summer.",
    "Part2": "What happened next? I can't remember exactly. But I remember how I felt. A strong wind blowing against my hair, the honk of a million cars stuck in traffic, the distance between me and the sun increasing in dramatic measure.",
    "Part3": "I was falling. Maybe someone had pushed me. Perhaps I had tripped. It felt like ten million years. I kept falling.",
    "Part4": "Nothing could stop me. Did I want something to stop me? With the force at which I was plummeting into the ground, surely I would not survive even if something did.",
    "Part5": "I wondered why I hadn't hit the ground. What would happen to me if I did? Perhaps there was no ground, because the world around me had disappeared. It was all a blur.",
    "Part6": "I had begun to count sheep. Accidentally skipped one or two and gave up. Certainly I was in the tens of thousands by the time I finally landed.",
    "Part7": "There was nothing to see. Nothing to smell. Nothing to hear. A dark black air of nothingness in front of and around me. How else could I describe it? What do I do?"
