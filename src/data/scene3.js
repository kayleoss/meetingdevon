    "Part1": "But I recognized it. The painted image I saw before me. I remembered! It was my dear sister.",

    "Part11": `I yelled at her for sending "Merry Christmas" cards to my home. Her religion wasn't my cup of tea.`,
    "Part12": `And just like that, I remembered everything.`,
    "Part13": `The last time I saw her was the summer of 1996. I haven't seen her in 30 years. She had changed her phone number and I didn't know where she was anymore. My eyes welled up with tears.`,

    "Part15": `"And?"`,
    "Part16": `"To where?"`
